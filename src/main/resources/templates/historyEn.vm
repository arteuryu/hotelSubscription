	The legacy beginning of Swiss International Hotels & Resorts can be chased back more than 30 years in 1982 when the brand was created by an alliance of a group of Swiss hoteliers. These hotel innovators are the guardians of what is now known as Swiss Hospitality Quality. The innovations and persistency of those pioneers not only have they set the cornerstones for the Swiss hospitality industry, they have also shaped the values believed in Swiss International Hotels & Resorts over the past 30 years, thereby extending the Brand into an internationally recognized brand of providing authentic Swiss quality of full services in hotel management.
